## The Story

Memseer is a product of my deep desire - I want everything running smoothly but without having to remember when and what to do in order to keep everything running smoothly.

It all started years ago when I used to have a small car with an interference engine. Interference engine is an engine where valve and piston traverse the same space but are carefully timed so they never meet each other. The engine has a timing belt that controls the valves and if the belt breaks, bad things will happen. If you are lucky, a couple valves might be broken, if unlucky the engine becomes junk. So I figured to keep a log with mileage and when the all important belt needed replacement. Not long after I also realized that there are other things that needed to be replaced on time or I might end up walking down the road.

Car as important as it is, isn’t the only thing to keep an eye on. I have UPS and it needs to have its battery replaced every 5-6 years, once again best case UPS doesn’t function properly, in worst case battery can actually burst into fire. What about air filter in HVAC system, I sure forgot about it few times and I never remember which filter size to buy. Personal health, when was my last checkup? What about pets, do they need yearly shots? Did I miss house insurance and what was the amount last year? Does my water filter need to be replaced? Is my treadmill track lubricated? And the list keeps going.

All those small things make an impact on our lives. The problem is: how to keep track of all whose small things? One way is sticky notes, but where do I keep them? On a fridge? On a furnace? Next to an entrance? Do I need to regularly revisit all those stickies and make sure stuff is done? Do sticky notes sometimes get lost? And once I’m done with a task, do I have a history to refer to, if the needs arise? Perhaps all the sticky notes can be organized into a binder, collected, managed and evaluated every weekend to figure out when and what chores needs to be done.

I tried the above approach with very limited success, unhealthy amount of anxiety and I still couldn’t remember which air filter size to buy once I got to the store. Perhaps there is a better way, organize notes into digital binder. It is always in one place - any place you are at! You can access it from anywhere on any device. Notes don’t get lost, complete history is always available. You don’t need to review all the notes every weekend to see when and what chores needs to be done. As a matter a fact, you don’t even have to make notes anymore, only rules and all the chores show up in simple, minimal & easy to understand format. Now I don’t have to remember when it is time to take my car to the shop for maintenance. I don’t have to memorize air filter size. I don’t worry that I missed something. All those small things are right in the palm of my hand.

## What’s Memseer?

Memseer is personal organizer that keeps track of your things by remembering events and associated actions.

At the core there are two functionalities: event creation - a record of what happened and actions associated to an event. Action describes when an event should be performed. Example: event - donate blood, action - repeat every 6 month.

Is Memseer a calendar? No it is not. You can’t create meetings or appointments. Memseer doesn’t have hard dates or time allocations. If you miss a task, Memseer will not forget about it, unlike calendar.

Is Memseer a todo list? Not exactly, while memseer can calculate when a task should be done, it doesn’t allow manual creation of one-off todo item. Memseer best suited for repeatable tasks.

Is Memseer a reminder? Not exactly, you can’t create reminders manually, however Memseer does remind you about repeatable tasks that should be accomplished.

## Use case: motorcycle

You have a motorcycle and you want to inspect chain every 500 kilometers. Go a head and create new item. Give it a name, check “work units” and select “kilometers”, don’t forget to select “origination date” in order to have proper scheduling. Now add new action by clicking “+” sign, filling out: “inspect chain every 500 kilometers” and click “done”. You will be brought back to the dashboard and you will see your item with a notice that it requires current kilometers in order to calculate schedule. Don’t worry this is one time action for new items. Click “add current kilometers” or red sign, fill in kilometers (all other fields are populated already) and click “save”. Back to the dashboard and you can see approximate time when you will have to inspect the chain.
You can set more actions around the event, let’s say regardless of milage you want to inspect the chain once every 6 month. You can create new action: “inspect chain every 6 months”. Now memseer will remind you to inspect the chain half a year after last inspection.

In addition to that you might want to inspect the chain more frequently during a particular season (tough conditions or more frequent use), and so you can add new action as such: “inspect chain every 2 month between August and November”.

## Use case: house

You have a house and it requires some minimum level of maintenance. Every few month air filter needs to be replaced. Do you need to inspect smoke and fire detectors once per year?
Every 12 years or so water tank needs to be replaced and perhaps every 15-20 years shingles on the roof should be replaced. No one enjoys waking up one morning without hot water or water dripping from a top. So lets create a house item and set few actions to it.

Add new item, name it and add following actions:
* Replace air filter every 3 months
* Inspect smoke detectors every 1 years
* Replace water heater every 12 years

You can add as many actions as you want but for the example lets leave it at those.

Click “done” and you will be landed to dashboard with “my house” needing some attention. It needs to know when last time you performed those actions in order to calculate schedule for the future. Let’s fill out that information.

Click on red icon next to “replace air filter” and change current date to the date when air filter got replaced last time. If you don’t remember, it is ok, just approximate. Now click “save” and you will be back to the dashboard. Fill out the rest of the missing information for “inspect smoke detectors” and “replace water heater”.

Now that everything is populated, you can see “my house” on the dashboard with information on each particular action: what is the action, when it should occur and last time the event took place. Everything is at the palm of your hand. Enjoy!

## Use case: lawn mower

You have gasoline lawn mower, like everything else it needs attention. For example: air filter needs to be cleaned every 25 hours of use. Oil change should be done every 50 hours of work or every 25 under heavy loads. Check grass bag every 100 hours of use and don’t forget to replace spark plug every 150 hours. In addition flywheel break pad, valve clearance and pinion gears should be check, adjusted and/or greased every 100 hours. Kinda long list to remember, but we can use memseer to keep track of each and every point.

Let’s add new item, give it a name “my lawn mower”, click “work units” and select “hours” from the dropdown. Let’s select “origination date” to manufacturing date, it can be approximated to a year if you don’t remember when it was purchased. Now it is time to set actions, click “+” under actions and populate fields so it reads as: “clean air filter every (repeats every) 25 hours”. Let’s keep adding new actions, click “+” for every new action:
* replace oil every 50 hours
* inspect grass bag every 100 hours
* replace spark plug every 150 hours
* inspect flywheel break pad every 100 hours
* adjust valve clearance every 100 hours
* add grease pinion gears every 100 hours

Now that you entered all the required actions, click “done”. You will land back to dashboard and see new item “my lawn mower” with warning sign saying “insufficient information… add current hours”. Memseer doesn’t know how many hours did you put on your lawn mower so far and it needs to know in order to calculate when and what needs to be done. Click on warning sign and populate field “hours” with current milage so to speak, let’s say you done 5 hours so far, enter 5 and click “save”, back to the dashboard and you can see “my lawn mower” with a schedule, “what and when” something needs to be done.

When time come and you completed an action, lets say “clean air filter”, you can click on check mark across the action on the dashboard, enter current hours (ex.: 25 hours) and memseer will re-calculate all the action in order to provide you with approximate count down when next action is required. You don’t have keep hand-written notes and check it every time you are about to use the mower.


## Use case: my cat (or any other pet)

You got a cat, which needs to be looked after, periodically vaccinated, given anti-parasite medication and occasionally have its nails cut. Let’s create new item, so we can effortlessly keep track of all important events. Give it a name and set origination date to the birthday of the cat. Next click “+” and add actions such as “anti parasite treatment”. Consult your veterinarian on the frequency of the treatment. In our example we will set frequency to every 3 month and a period from March to November. One more thing, it would be nice to have medication name and brand written down, so you don’t have to remember or search for it if you need to purchase it again. Click on yellow icon “notes” and add all the information. Now click “done” and you will be returned to the dashboard. At this point you can start keeping a log of pet’s treatment. Click icon “checkbox” and enter a date when you gave your pet anti-parasite medication last time. Don’t forget to click “save”, so memseer remembers the information and calculates next date for the action.
