### Version v.22.5.16:
**Bug fix: origination date**

The bug occurs when you set origination date of an item in to the future.
Item schedule calculates incorrectly and provide use with bad information.

Now user can't pick a date in the future, only in the past. However, there is a manual override, which is not restricted at least for now.

### Version v.22.5.2:
**New feature: insufficient units of work**

Now maintenance card displays an action due to insufficient units of work data (such as kilometers/miles/hours) .
In order to have proper schedule calculated, the maintenance card asks user to fill out current units of work.

Steps:
- Create new item with 'work units' and action/s with a unit of work (ex. miles)
- Given there are no prior events associated with the action
- Navigate to dashboard and find the item, it should have a task with red icon, noting that sufficient information, 'please add current miles'

### Version v.22.4.23:
**New feature: maintenance card items for actions with insufficient events**

Now maintenance card displays actions that can't be calculated due to insufficient event data.
In order to have proper schedule calculated, the maintenance card asks user to fill out past events.

Steps:
- Create new action in new or existing item
- Given there are no prior events associated with the action
- Navigate to dashboard and find the item, it should have a task with red icon, noting that sufficient data is missing for the action

**Bug fix: import of unsupported formats**

The bug occurs when you import a file of unsupported format, for example: .jpeg or .pdf
Supported import formats are:
- json - for item and actions import
- csv - for events import

Now software is explicit about what kind of file can be imported and does not allow empty events or actions.

### Version 22.3.19:
**Bug fix: mismatching events and actions**

The bug might occur when importing/exporting events and items.
Events and actions stop associating, preventing correct scheduling.

**Bug fix: no more undefined in action-event tooltip**

The bug doesn't do any harm, but visually confusing.
Tooltips should not present any 'undefined'.


### Version 22.3.12:
**New feature: work hours**

Now you can record working hours of any equipment, for example: treadmill

Steps:
- Add new item
- Give it a name, example Treadmill Pro 2000
